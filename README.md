# WHAR Datasets

This library provides data handling support for popular WHAR (Wearable Human Activity Recognition) datasets including

<!-- - metadata descriptions in [DCAT-AP](https://www.dcat-ap.de/) and [Croissant](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant) -->
- downloading from original source
- parsing into a standardized data format
- configuration-driven preprocessing, splitting, normalization, and more
- integration with pytorch and tensorflow

# How to Install

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/teco-kit/whar-datasets.git"
```

This installs the library into the active environment.

# How To Use With PyTorch

```python
from whar_datasets import (
    Loader,
    LOSOSplitter,
    PostProcessingPipeline,
    PreProcessingPipeline,
    TorchAdapter,
    WHARDatasetID,
    get_dataset_cfg,
)

# create cfg for WISDM dataset
cfg = get_dataset_cfg(WHARDatasetID.WISDM)

# create and run pre-processing pipeline
pre_pipeline = PreProcessingPipeline(cfg)
activity_df, session_df, window_df = pre_pipeline.run()

# create LOSO splits
splitter = LOSOSplitter(cfg)
splits = splitter.get_splits(session_df, window_df)
split = splits[0]

# create and run post-processing pipeline for the specific split
post_pipeline = PostProcessingPipeline(cfg, pre_pipeline, window_df, split.train_indices)
samples = post_pipeline.run()

# create dataloaders for the specific split
loader = Loader(session_df, window_df, post_pipeline.samples_dir, samples)
adapter = TorchAdapter(cfg, loader, split)
dataloaders = adapter.get_dataloaders(batch_size=64)
```

Not yet natively supported WHAR datasets can be integrated via a custom configuration (with parser).
